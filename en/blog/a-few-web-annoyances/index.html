                    <h1>A few web annoyances</h1>
                    <div class="blog-entry-date">August 28, 2017</div>
                    <p>I've been meaning to write a blog post titled "things on websites that are annoying" for quite a while. I changed the title and finaly decided to write about it. These web design practices could be considred bad and intrusive. Let's begin.</p>
                    <h4>Infinte scroll</h4>
                    <img alt="Infinite scroll" src="infinite-scroll.jpg" />
                    <p>I almost seem to remember when this trend started. At first it may seem like a good way to show large ammounts of data on a single page, but when that conents is abundant, then infinite scrolling seems unpractical because you have to navigate up or donw through a lot of content, sometimes on certain websites you can't even reach the footer. Pagination could be a solution instead of scrolling down until the end of times.</p>
                    <h4>Intrusive pop ups</h4>
                    <img alt="Popup" src="popup-newsletter.jpg" />
                    <p>This is a big one, I hate them. Simply put they are intrusive pop ups that do nothing more than give you a reason to close them before you even interact with them, or at least that's how I see them. Do you subscribe to newsletters or answer to site surveys through this medium? They come out of the blue most often asking for something you didn't get on that website to beging with, so it's annoying.</p>
                    <h4>Autoplay videos</h4>
                    <img alt="Autoplay" src="autoplay.jpg" />
                    <p>Autoplay videos are super annoying; if I hear some sound coming from a tab on my web browser I immediately turn the volume off, close the video or close that tab altogether. Please, don't ever put autoplay videos on your website with the volume on.</p>
                    <h4>'Show notifications' browser message</h4>
                    <img alt="Notifications" src="notifications.jpg" />
                    <p>Ugh... notifications that come out of the blue break the "user experience" or creat a bad user experience. Don't break the look and feel of your website with notifications.</p>
                    <h4>Pop ups showing up as you scroll down</h4>
                    <img alt="Bottom popups" src="bottom-popups.jpg" />
                    <p>Yeah, those as well. Popups at the bottom of the page are super bothersome.</p>
                    <h4>Click link then continue to site</h4>
                    <img alt="Continue to website" src="continue.jpg" />
                    <p>Who came up with this awful idea? Sometimes when I try to reach a specific link an intermediate page shows up with an ad in the middle forcing you to see it and if you want to reach your desired page, you have to click on the "continue" link. Terrible.</p>
                    <h4>Accept cookies</h4>
                    <img alt="Cookies" src="cookies.jpg" />
                    <p>"This website uses cookes". Ok, I can live with that, after all... there are ways to block cookies from websites, and for that reason I don't really care if your website is storing cookies on my computer.</p>
                    <p>The end.</p>
